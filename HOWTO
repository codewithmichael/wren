How To Build Wren From Scratch
==============================

This is a brief overview on how to build a portable USB Wren installation.
It assumes a working knowledge of Linux, including how to mount, partition, and
format hard disks.

Wren is presently built around Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1 LTS 32-bit. The 32-bit
version has better system compatibility and partitions/boots using MBR/BIOS
instead of GPT/UEFI.

The Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 32-bit LiveCD does not presently support loop devices.
The Wren builder (wrender) requires loop devices, so Wren cannot be built from
the Ubuntu LiveCD. This issue is addressed below.


Requirements
------------

* Build machine or virtual machine with at least 2 GB RAM (4 GB preferred)
* Temporary disk to store an Ubuntu installation
* Portable USB disk, such as a thumb drive, 8 GB or larger
* Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1 LTS 32-bit LiveCD iso or disc
* Network connection (disconnected during installation)


Terminology
-----------

* LIVECD          The Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS 32-bit LiveCD iso or disc
* ROOT DISK       The temporary disk used to store an Ubuntu installation
* WREN DISK       The portable USB disk used to store the Wren installation
* ROOT PARTITION  The bootable partition on the ROOT DISK containing Ubuntu
* WREN PARTITION  The bootable partition on the WREN DISK containing Wren
* ROOT IMAGE      A SquashFS image created from the ROOT PARTITION
* WREN SOURCE     The Wren source code
* PLATFORM IMAGE  A SquashFS image generated from the Wren build script
* INITRD IMAGE    A cpio image containing the initramfs boot scripts
* KERNEL IMAGE    A copy of the kernel image extracted from the ROOT IMAGE


Assumptions
-----------

* ROOT DISK device path is /dev/sda
* WREN DISK device path is /dev/sdb
* WREN DISK will have 3 partitions
  * sdb1  format:fat32       label:STORAGE  (at least 1 GiB)
  * sdb2  format:linux-swap  label:SWAP     (at least 1 GiB)
  * sdb3  format:ext2        label:WREN     (at least 4 GiB)
* ROOT PARTITION will be mounted at /mnt/ROOT
* WREN PARTITION will be mounted at /mnt/WREN


STEP 1 - Prepare the WREN DISK (Boot from LIVECD)
-------------------------------------------------

* Boot using the LIVECD in "Try Ubuntu" mode.
* Use gparted or fdisk/parted to partition and format the WREN DISK:
  * Primary Partition 1  format:fat32       label:STORAGE  (1+ GiB)
  * Primary Partition 2  format:linux-swap  label:SWAP     (1+ GiB)
  * Primary Partition 3  format:ext2        label:WREN     (4+ GiB)
* Set the boot flag on the WREN PARTITION (sdb3) to make it bootable
* Mount the WREN PARTITION
* Install Grub to the WREN DISK (root/sudo)
  * grub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=/mnt/WREN/boot /dev/sdb


STEP 2 - Generate a Root Image (Boot from LIVECD)
-------------------------------------------------

* DISCONNECT FROM THE NETWORK
* Boot using the LIVECD in "Try Ubuntu" mode.
* Install Ubuntu to the ROOT DISK, but DO NOT reboot.
* CONNECT TO THE NETWORK
* Update apt package list (root/sudo)
  * apt-get update
* Use apt to install "squashfs-tools" (root/sudo)
  * apt-get install squashfs-tools
* Mount the ROOT PARTITION as read-only
* Mount the WREN PARTITION as read-write
* Create a boot/images directory on the WREN PARTITION
* Use mksquashfs to generate the ROOT IMAGE (root/sudo)
  * mksquashfs /mnt/ROOT /mnt/WREN/boot/images/root.sfs -comp gzip


STEP 3 - Build Wren Images (Boot from ROOT DISK)
------------------------------------------------

* Boot from the ROOT DISK or use an existing Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS installation.
* Download the WREN SOURCE
* Remove all git related files from the WREN SOURCE
* cd to the WREN SOURCE install/ directory
* Download required builder packages from apt into WREN SOURCE install/
  * apt-get download squashfs-tools watershed lvm2
* Use dpkg to install squashfs-tools package (if it's not already installed)
* cd to the WREN SOURCE directory
* Create a boot/conf directory on the WREN PARTITION
* Copy grub.cfg from WREN SOURCE conf/ to WREN PARTITION boot/grub/
* Copy *.conf   from WREN SOURCE conf/ to WREN PARTITION boot/conf/
* Build the Wren images (root/sudo)
  * ./wrender -r /mnt/WREN/boot/images/root.sfs -d /mnt/WREN/boot/images
* cd to the WREN PARTITION boot/images directory
* Create symlinks for the INITRD IMAGE and KERNEL IMAGE (root/sudo)
  * ln -s initrd.img-* initrd.img
  * ln -s vmlinuz-* vmlinuz


STEP 4 - Test (Boot from WREN DISK)
-----------------------------------

* Boot from the WREN DISK
* Select from the Grub menu
* Wait for Ubuntu welcome screen
* Login
